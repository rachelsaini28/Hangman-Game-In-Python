# Hangman-Game-In-Python
In this project I created a beginner's Hangman game using basic Python.

Features in my project:

- user is given instructions to play

- words to guess are ranging in difficulty, some being shorter, while some being longer

- implemented ASCII illustrations to visualize the hangman each time the user
guesses a letter incorectly

- user recieves in-game feedback as they guess a letter (e.g. # of attempts left, letters already guessed, if letter is correct/incorrect)
